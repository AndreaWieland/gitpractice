## Git Commands Sandbox

This repo is for my friends to play around with git and github on a repo that we can't mess up! You won't find any interesting code here, but feel free to practice your PRs and rebases here.

#### Some useful commands
` git pull origin `

` git checkout -b my_new_branch_name `

` git branch `


` git add --all `

` git commit -m "brief commit description" `

` git push -u origin my_new_branch_name `

` git checkout main `
